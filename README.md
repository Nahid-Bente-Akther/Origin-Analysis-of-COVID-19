# Origin-Analysis-of-COVID-19
To find out the origin of SARS Cov-2 who comes from the same family of Coronaviridae, I selected here 7 different species. The host's taxonomy ID as follows:
    Rhinolophus (horseshoe bats), taxid:49442
    Gallus gallus (chicken), taxid:9031
    Homo sapins (human), taxid: 9606
    Artiodactyla(pigs, whales, camel,ruminants, hippos etc), taxid: 91561
    Anatidae(waterfowl), taxid: 8830
    Apodemus chevrieri(field mouse), taxid: 129246
After getting all file in fasta format. Here all file marged into one output file. Then the sequence is aligned and trimmed with threshold value 250. 
 To generate the phylogenetic tree here then used UPGMA algorithm.
